THREE MODULES:

* Bamazon Customer (node bamazonCustomer) -- Allows user to purchase new products. 

* Bamazon Manager (node bamazonManager) -- Allows user to View Products for Sale, View Low Inventory, Add to Inventory, or Add New Product

* Bamazon Supervisor (node bamazonSupervisor) -- Currently only can display product sales by department; total product sales by department is not correct though. There were several issues that I ran into with MySql, I explain my problems in the second video.
